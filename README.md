## 📖 Introduction
The Morse code encodes every character as a sequence of "dots" and "dashes". For example, the letter A is coded as `·−`, the letter Q is coded as `−−·−`, and the digit 1 is coded as `·−−−−`. The Morse code is case-insensitive and traditionally capital letters are used. When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate the character codes and three spaces are used to separate words. For example, the message `HEY JUDE` in Morse code is `···· · −·−−   ·−−− ··− −·· ·`.

**🔔 Note:** Extra spaces before or after the code have no meaning and should be ignored.

## 🎯 The Task
Your task is to implement a function that would take the morse code as input and return a decoded human-readable string.

**🔍 For example:**

```bash
decodeMorse('.... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. .')
//should return "HEY JUDE"
```

## ✨ Features
- Decode Morse code to a human-readable string.
- Ignore extra spaces before and after the code.
- Supports all standard Morse code characters.

## 📥 Installation
To use the Morse code decoder, simply clone this repository and include the function in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/achiyat/algorithms-morse.git
```
